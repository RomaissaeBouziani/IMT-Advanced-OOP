# Exercises

The objectives of these exercises are to practice concepts covered in the lectures.

There are no explicit exercise about tests: remember that testing should be reflex.
In the following exercices, you must therefore take the initiative of building tests.

## Exercice 16-10-3: Finish the logical gate exercise

Finish exercise 15-10-3.


## Exercice 16-10-4: Project introduction (Civilization)

In this chapter you will design a simplified version of the combat mechanics in turn-based strategy games such as Civilization or [FreeCiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeciv) as an open-source alternative. 

At the end of this exercise, you will obtain a base model of the civilization game that you will use later on your project.

Follow the instructions of Chapter 14 from the [exercice book](http://rmod-pharo-mooc.lille.inria.fr/AdvancedDesignMooc/2024-04-01-CompanionExercise.pdf).
